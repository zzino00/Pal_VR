Goddess Sword extracted from Skyward Sword. I'm not able to find the sheath model for Goddess Sword. I have found the texture for it in 2 of the .arc.LZ file but no sign of the model. The Sword is the high detail model likely used for cut scenes.

Textures are not broken. The model(s) is made use mirrored texture tiling.

Tools:
Dolphin to extract the .arc.LZ files
Puyo Tools Bin 1.0.7 to decompress .arc.LZ files
BREES Viewer V1.02 to convert to psk files
Blender 2.78 via psk/psa import plug-in to save a .obj
